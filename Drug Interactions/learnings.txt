Nitrogen (N):
Sandy soils typically have lower nitrogen levels because nitrogen is highly soluble and can easily leach below the root zone in sandy soils.
Clay soils tend to have higher nitrogen levels because they have higher organic matter content, which contributes to nitrogen retention.
Loamy soils often have moderate nitrogen levels and can retain nitrogen better than sandy soils but may not have as high nitrogen levels as clay soils.
Phosphorus (P):
Clay soils usually have higher phosphorus levels because clay particles have a greater surface area to adsorb phosphorus ions.
Sandy soils may have lower phosphorus levels because phosphorus is less likely to be retained and may leach out of the soil.
Loamy soils generally have moderate phosphorus levels and can retain phosphorus better than sandy soils but may not have as high phosphorus levels as clay soils.
Potassium (K):
Clay soils often have higher potassium levels because potassium is held tightly by clay particles and is less prone to leaching.
Sandy soils may have lower potassium levels because potassium is more susceptible to leaching in sandy soils.
Loamy soils usually have moderate potassium levels and can retain potassium better than sandy soils but may not have as high potassium levels as clay soils.
